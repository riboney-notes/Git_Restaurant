### Project Goals

- [ ] Handle merge conflicts
- [ ] Get exposure to feature branching 
- [ ] Use tools such as gitdiff, gitgraph, etc
- [ ] Learning to read and understand git logs
- [ ] Modifying commit history with git rebase and git squash 
- [ ] Being able to revert changes with git

## Project Description

- The main idea of this project is to work with text files to simulate working with code, which allows anyone to participate regardless of their coding experience
- Participants will be creating a *Three course meal* or *Breakfast, Lunch, and Dinner* üçΩ
   - This will consist of pushing commits that contain the ingredients & cooking steps & possibly pictures of the food, into each meal's folder
- Here are some ideas participants can do to simulate real-life software project scenarios: 
   - Create a "bug" for the team to solve in the form of a complaint with a meal's ingredient and a request to change it for another ingredient
   - Have members work on the same file and push commits at the same time to force merge conflicts
   - Investigate the source of a food poisioning by analyzing the `git log` and using `git graph` and finding which commit was responsble for the poison
   - Remove a meal from the code base by reverting a merge

## Tasks

- [ ] Fork the repository 
- [ ] If more than 2 people, divide up people to *breakfast, lunch, dinner* teams
- [ ] ...
