## About

- This project is designed to expose its participants to various git workflows and features

## Prerequisites & Info

- Install git: [instructions](https://github.com/git-guides/install-git)
- Customize git & github: [instructions](https://kbroman.org/github_tutorial/pages/first_time.html)
- Clone git repository: [instructions](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/cloning-a-repository)

### Goals

- [ ] Handle merge conflicts
- [ ] Get exposure to feature branching 
- [ ] Use tools such as gitdiff, gitgraph, etc
- [ ] Learning to read and understand git logs
- [ ] Modifying commit history with git rebase and git squash 
- [ ] Being able to revert changes with git

## Description

- **WHAT**: 
   - Work on text files to simulate working with code and real-life development scenarios
- **WHY**: 
   - Allow anyone, regardless of coding experience, to participate and learn to work with git
- **HOW**
   - Participants will be working on a *Three course meal* üçΩ
   - **WTF?**: 
      - Participants will create git commits consisting of ingredients, cooking actions, pictures, etc to create "meals"
- **Scenarios!**: 
   - *Scenario*: A recipe for a meal needs to be changed 
      - *Reason*: Changing app requirements during development
      - *Outcome*: Get exposure to creating git issues and handling it with feature branching workflow
   - *Scenario*: Have two people team up (*like Remyüê≠ and Alfredoüßë‚Äçüç≥ from Ratatouille*)
      - *Reason*: Have members work on the same file and push commits at the same time to create merge conflicts 
      - *Outcome*: Learning to handle merge conflicts and sync with `main` when merging commits
   - *Scenario*: Investigate the source of a food poisioning 
      - *Reason*: Analyzing commit history to find which commit was responsble for the "poison"
      - *Outcome*: using the `git log` and using `git graph`  
   - *Scenario*: Customer hates the meal and sends it back
      - *Reason*: Remove recent merges into git main 
      - *Outcome*: Learning to revert commits and bring back codebase to an earlier version
